\label{sec:FinalAnswer}%
Linear regression with equations is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It involves finding the equation of a straight line that best fits the data points, which takes the form y = mx + b, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y{-}intercept. This method is used to make predictions and understand the relationship between variables. Additionally, it can be modified to change our understanding of the sources of gravity and has applications in NLS{-}type equations with time dependent potential terms and radial data in three dimensions, as well as in the two{-}body Quantum Scattering case.
