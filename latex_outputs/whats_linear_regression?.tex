Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is commonly employed in various fields such as economics, engineering, and social sciences. In different contexts, linear regression is utilized for tasks such as recovering piecewise linear functions, accelerating core tensor updates in low{-}rank tensor decomposition, and certifying data{-}bias robustness in linear regression models. These applications demonstrate the versatility and importance of linear regression in analyzing and predicting the behavior of data.
