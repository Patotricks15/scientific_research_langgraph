\label{sec:FinalAnswer}%
Linear regression is a statistical technique used to recover a function that is promised to be piecewise linear on an unknown set of rectangles, with the goal of achieving a desired accuracy in mean{-}squared error. It is a computationally efficient algorithm that relies on a simple iterative merging approach and has been shown to be competitive and, in some cases, outperform state{-}of{-}the{-}art heuristics in experimental evaluations. Additionally, it involves updating the core tensor in the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm using tools from randomized numerical linear algebra called ridge leverage scores, allowing for the acceleration of the core tensor update step and making it a highly{-}structured ridge regression problem. This technique is effective for large, low{-}rank Tucker decompositions on both synthetic and real{-}world data. Furthermore, linear regression is also used to certify whether models trained on datasets are robust to label bias, helping to determine when to trust or question a model's output.
