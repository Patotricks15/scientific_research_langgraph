Linear regression is a statistical technique used to recover a function that is promised to be piecewise linear on an unknown set of rectangles, with the goal of achieving a desired accuracy in mean{-}squared error. It is a computationally efficient algorithm that relies on a simple iterative merging approach and has been shown to be competitive and, in some cases, outperform state{-}of{-}the{-}art heuristics in experimental evaluations. Additionally, it involves decomposing a tensor using tools from randomized numerical linear algebra, specifically ridge leverage scores, to accelerate the core tensor update step in the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm, making it a powerful tool for low{-}rank Tucker decompositions in large datasets. This technique can also be used to certify whether models trained on datasets are robust to label bias, helping to determine when to trust or question a model's output.
